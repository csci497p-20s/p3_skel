def preprocess_ncc_impl(image, ncc_size):

    Prepare normalized patch vectors according to normalized cross
    correlation.

    This is a preprocessing step for the NCC pipeline.  It is expected that
    'preprocess_ncc' is called on every input image to preprocess the NCC
    vectors and then 'compute_ncc' is called to compute the dot product
    between these vectors in two images.

    NCC preprocessing has two steps.
    (1) Compute and subtract the mean.
    (2) Normalize the vector.

    The mean is per channel.  i.e. For an RGB image, over the ncc_size**2
    patch, compute the R, G, and B means separately.  The normalization
    is over all channels.  i.e. For an RGB image, after subtracting out the
    RGB mean, compute the norm over the entire (ncc_size**2 * channels)
    vector and divide.

    If the norm of the vector is < 1e-6, then set the entire vector for that
    patch to zero.

    Patches that extend past the boundary of the input image at all should be
    considered zero.  Their entire vector should be set to 0.

    Patches are flattened into vectors with the default numpy row
    major order.  For example, the following 3D numpy array with shape
    2 (channels) x 2 (height) x 2 (width) patch...

    channel1         channel2
    +------+------+  +------+------+ height
    | x111 | x121 |  | x112 | x122 |  |
    +------+------+  +------+------+  |
    | x211 | x221 |  | x212 | x222 |  |
    +------+------+  +------+------+  v
    width ------->

    gets unrolled using np.reshape into a vector in the following order:

    v = [ x111, x121, x211, x221, x112, x122, x212, x222 ]

    Input:
        image -- height x width x channels image of type float32
        ncc_size -- integer side length of (square) NCC patch region; must be odd
    Output:
        normalized -- height x width x (channels * ncc_size**2) array
